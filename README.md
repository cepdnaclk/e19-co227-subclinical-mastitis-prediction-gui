## Introduction

In this project we aim to develop a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that integrates a prediction model for subclinical mastitis in dairy cows. The software aims to provide dairy farm owners with an intuitive tool to manage their farms effectively. The GUI presents the prediction results in a user-friendly manner, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding herd health and milk production.

## Getting Started

Welcome to our project! To get started, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment to ensure you're using the same dependencies as the project. This guide will walk you through the process on a Windows machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your computer:

1. **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. If not, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   First, clone our project repository to your local machine. Open the terminal inside your desired location and clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e19-co227-subclinical-mastitis-prediction-gui.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**

   Change your current directory to the cloned repository:

   ```shell
   cd e19-co227-subclinical-mastitis-prediction-gui
   ```

3. **Create and Activate the Virtual Environment:**

   
   To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   This will create a virtual environment named "venv" in the repository directory.

   <mark>Please use 'venv' for the name of the virtual environment as it is already ignored from the gitignore.</mark>

   Next, activate the virtual environment:

   ```shell
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   Your command prompt should now show the virtual environment name, indicating that you are working within it.

4. **Install Project Dependencies:**

   With the virtual environment activated, you can install the project's dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the required packages for the project.

5. **Start Working on the Project:**

   You're all set! You can now start working on the project within the virtual environment. Any Python scripts you run or modifications you make to the project will use the isolated environment.

6. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**

   When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

   ```shell
   deactivate
   ```

   This will return you to your system's global Python environment.

Now you're ready to collaborate on our project. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
