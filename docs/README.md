## Introduction

In this project we aim to develop a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that integrates a prediction model for subclinical mastitis in dairy cows. The software aims to provide dairy farm owners with an intuitive tool to manage their farms effectively. The GUI presents the prediction results in a user-friendly manner, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding herd health and milk production.
