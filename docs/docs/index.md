# Project Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of our project, where we introduce a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) integrated with a subclinical mastitis prediction model for dairy cows. Our software is designed with the primary goal of empowering dairy farm owners with a comprehensive and intuitive tool to manage their farms effectively. This documentation serves as a guide to understanding the features, functionalities, and best practices for utilizing our user-friendly GUI in the context of dairy farm management.

## Project Objective
Our project focuses on developing a practical solution for dairy farm management. The GUI streamlines the process of predicting subclinical mastitis, a common health concern in dairy cows, and presents the prediction results in a user-friendly manner.

## Empowering Dairy Farmers
We aim to provide dairy farm owners with the means to make informed decisions about herd health and milk production. By offering an accessible and insightful interface, our software assists in managing dairy farms with greater efficiency and precision.
